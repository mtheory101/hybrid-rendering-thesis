== Paper ==
== Programming ==
==== Framework ====
  * Set up basic deferred rasterization render pipeline.
  * Use file watcher to reload edited data files at runtime.
  * Set up scene and engine using data files for easy parameter tweaking.
  * Rewrite render pipeline into something flexible enough to give mix-and-match support to rasterization and raytracing techniques.
  * Integrate a good performance/profiling tool/logger.
==== Rasterization ====
  * Vanilla deferred shading integration based on [http://www.codinglabs.net/tutorial_simple_def_rendering.aspx Coding Labs]'s article.
==== Raytracing ====
==== Voxels ====
